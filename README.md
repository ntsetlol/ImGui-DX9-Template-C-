# ImGui-DX9-Template-C-
ImGui DirectX 9 Template written in C++

Comes with a working CMakeLists.txt linking the imgui files + backends.
These files come with the clone but if you desire you could change the CMake include directories to your own folder containing such.
This is just an easy way to get started coding an ImGui application with C++.

How to use:

1. Clone the repo in your desired directory
2. Build with CMake
3. Add onto the template
